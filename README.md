# Welcome to Mimesis, where STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning is combined with theatre and performing arts techniques to make learning fun and creative, following the STEAM pedagogy.

Mimesis is an Erasmus+ project that aims to develop students' scientific intuition while also enhancing their knowledge and communication skills. The project focuses on creating approaches and educational activities that incorporate theatrical and body movement techniques in STEAM learning (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics), creating a fun and inclusive learning environment. With the guidance of theatre professionals, these activities aim to facilitate multidisciplinary learning alongside traditional teaching. Our educational proposals are designed for young people aged 8 to 12 years old and are designed to support teachers in conducting creative and inspiring activities in the classroom with minimal materials.

## What can you expect from the Mimesis in English Repository?

The Mimesis Resources provide a comprehensive set of content for science teachers to stimulate classroom discussions on science and society, enhancing STEM skills using theatre and performing arts techniques. The content is designed for students aged 8 to 12 years old. The Mimesis Resources consists of five complementary toolkits, each providing specific teaching and supporting resources. These toolkits include:

### Toolkit 1 - Guidance on playful techniques for addressing STEM education challenges

This toolkit offers strategies and techniques to engage students playfully in STEM education. It emphasizes hands-on activities, experiments, and creative approaches to foster curiosity, exploration, problem-solving, and critical thinking. These techniques also develop 21st-century competencies such as collaboration, communication, and creativity.

### Toolkit 2 - Theatre Cards for introducing performing arts in STEAM education

This toolkit provides an overview of theatrical techniques used within the project and demonstrates their application in STEM activities. By incorporating performing arts, educators can enhance students' learning experiences, promote engagement, and develop creativity, self-confidence, and communication skills.

### Toolkit 3 - Mimesis Teacher Cards

This toolkit concisely presents each Mimesis activity. It provides an overview of the Activity Sheets' content, including STEM learning objectives and performing arts integration. These resources are valuable for teachers to create their learning sequences or draw inspiration for pedagogical proposals. It includes printable content and everything to ease the implementation of Mimesis in the classroom.

### Toolkit 4 - Guidance for Effective Implementation of Mimesis in the Classroom

This section offers advice from project experts on successfully integrating performing arts techniques into the classroom. It guides deploying Mimesis within schools or different learning contexts.

### Toolkit 5 - Guidance on Script Development

This toolkit offers advice on developing scripts based on Mimesis activities for incorporating performing arts techniques in the STEM classroom. It provides insights and recommendations on creating scripts that effectively integrate STEM learning with theatrical and body movement techniques. The guidance aims to support teachers in designing creative and inspiring activities that engage students and foster a fun and inclusive learning environment.
